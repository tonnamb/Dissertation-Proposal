Although there numerous efforts to solidify the nucleation and growth mechanisms of these syntheses \cite{Lofton_2005,Mariscal_2012,Park_2013,Viswanath_2009,Liao_2014,Chang_2011,Murph_2015}, these mechanisms still remain elusive due to the lack of atomic resolution and quantitative data. This proposal describes how atomistic-scale simulation can be used to probe the nucleation and growth mechanisms.
