\subsection{Mechanistic Studies of Shape Control}

Background:

Xia 2015 Kinetics Thermodynamics

Nanocrystals synthesis can be viewed as a set of sequential and parallel chemical reactions.
Each route of chemical reactions yields nanocrystals of different dimensions and morphology.
The end product of chemical reactions can be controlled by a set of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.
For the synthesis of metal nanocrystals, thermodynamic parameters can include reduction potential and surface capping.
The kinetic parameters can include concentration, mass transport, temperature, and the involvement of foreign species.
These parameters dictates the shape of the free energy landscape and how well the system can minimize its free energy.
The free energy landscape can be depicted by wells of minima separated by free energy barriers, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:energy-landscape}.
