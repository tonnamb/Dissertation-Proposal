\section{Introduction}

Nanoscale materials have the potential to solve many of today's biggest problems such as peak oil, global water crisis, and burden of cancer.
Faraday's discovery of colloidal nanostructured gold producing different colored solutions in 1857 have inspired generations of research in nanotechnology.
