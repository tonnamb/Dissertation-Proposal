The scope of my investigation is limited to the synthesis of colloidal metal nanocrystals, particularly silver (Ag).
The polyol synthesis is the most popular solution-phase synthesis of Ag nanocrystals \cite{Skrabalak_2007}.
The typical reaction temperature is $150^{\circ}$ C.
In the polyol synthesis, ethylene glycol acts as both the solvent and the reducing agent.
The source of Ag is from AgNO_3 that is dissolved in ethylene glycol.
Structure-directing agents, typically polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), are added to prevent aggregation of nanocrystals and direct their shape.
The ratio of PVP to AgNO_3 is critical to the formation of different nanocrystal shapes, ranging from cubes, triangular plates, and five-fold twinned pentagonal wires.
