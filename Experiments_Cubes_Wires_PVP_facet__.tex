Through decades of research, different aspects of the shape control mechanism in colloidal metal nanocrystals synthesis have been gathered.
Because of the complexity of the collodial synthesis, we are still far from being able to describe the mechanism in precise atomic details.
Previous efforts of experimentalists and theoriests to decipher the shape control mechanism will be described respectively below.
The scope of this review will be on the polyol synthesis of Ag nanocrystals in the presence of PVP as the structure directing agent.
