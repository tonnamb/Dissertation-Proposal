\subsection{Motivations}
The numerous potential applications of metal nanocrystals has brought our attention towards the science behind shape-control nanocrystals synthesis. Various properties of metal nanocrystals have been investigated in applications such as catalysis,\cite{Burda_2005} surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS),\cite{McLellan_2006} integrated circuits,\cite{Wiley_2006} high-density storage media,\cite{Aslam_2005} medicine,\cite{Au_2008} and self-assembly of structures.\cite{Glotzer_2007} The properties of metal nanocrystals can be tailored to a specific application by manipulating its size, shape, composition, and structure.\cite{Xia_2008} Through shape-control synthesis of metal nanocrystals, shape-property relationships can be investigated and the most desirable shape that attains optimal properties can be determined. An outline of the phases in Ag nanocrystals synthesis is shown in Figure 1.
