\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Scope}

Nanostructure is an assembly of atoms or molecules with a microstructure at the nanoscale. Well-defined shapes of metal nanostructures such as cube \cite{Im_2005}, octahedron \cite{Xia_2012}, icosahedron \cite{Xiong_2007}, triangular plate \cite{Lofton_2005} and five-fold twinned pentagonal wire \cite{Tsuji_2008} can be synthesized in the colloidal system. A comprehensive review of shape-controlled solution-phase synthesis of metal nanostructures is given in the reference \cite{Xia_2008}. The nucleation and growth mechanisms still need clarification and proof for the synthesis to be more of a science than an art.
